# Stop_and_Frisk_Classification-
Team: Mahmoud Badi, Aman Preet Singh, and Rahul Khandalkar 

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis and a Classification project on NYPD's Stop-and-Frisk dataset. We are trying to classify and predict
arrests based on the given features. We use different binary classification techniques and demonstrate the performance of each using area
under the curve and confusion matrix.
